# Automatic-Timetracking
### Senior Design Project: Spring 2020

This application detects Windows processes and captures logs as well as updates the UI in real time.

This is an enhancement of a previous iteration of this project where this group sucessfully:
- added extra user identification in the form of Username, IP Addresses, IP Hostname, and MAC Address
- added an OCR image-to-text feature to convert screenshot captures to text which is outputted as a new field in the report JSON log
- added a simple data analysis feature to evaluate logged information, including OCR text
- improved performance by moving certain actions onto background worker threads
  
We utilized Visual Studio and C# to work on this project, and it works locally if you pull this repo and run the "start without debugging" command and are delivering a runnable .msi to Fellows Consulting Group.

### Senior Design Project: Fall 2021
