    /*
     * Wrapper used: https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/
     * Sample code for seeing how to use library: https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract-samples
     * 
     * Workflow explained in order --
     * Constructor's contents and explanation:
     * This class will, upon creation, create a directory for output files and contain 2 path variables.
     * One path variable is for screencaps and the other is for the text files this class makes (which is the created directory).
     * These will be set in the constructor. 
     * 
     *      Tangent: There shouldn't even be a need for supplying arguments to the constructor, we should get 
     *      values from a project-wide constants file. We need to make that though (so for now we have a constructor which requires arguments).
     * 
     * Functions, their contents and explanation: 
     * There will be 2 functions other than basic getters/setters as applicable. A read function and a writeToFile function.
     * 
     * The read function will load an image using the filepath as an argument and perform the OCR process on it. 
     * It will then return a string, which will be passed into the writetoFile function.
     * 
     * The writeToFile function will write the contents to a .txt file which shares the name of the image Tesseract read the text from.
